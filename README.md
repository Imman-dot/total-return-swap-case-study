# Total Return Swaps (TRS) Case Study

## üìå Overview
This project explores how hedge funds used **Total Return Swaps (TRS)** to avoid UK taxes, how regulators closed the loophole, and what risks swaps still create today.  

It includes:  
- **Report** (below in this README)  
- **Notes** (`/notes/rough-notes.md`)  
- **Excel/Python models** (`/model/`)  
- **Charts** (`/images/`)  
- **References** (`/references/`)
