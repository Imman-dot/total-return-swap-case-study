1. What is a TRS?

A Total Return Swap (TRS) is a financial contract.
Two sides:
Hedge fund (or investor): receives profits/losses of an asset (like a stock or bond).
Bank (dealer): actually owns the asset and passes through returns.
Hedge fund pays a financing fee (usually interest, like LIBOR + spread).
Effect: The hedge fund has full economic exposure without legal ownership.

👉 Example: Hedge fund does TRS on £10m of Tesco stock.
If Tesco rises 10%, hedge fund gains £1m.
If Tesco falls 10%, hedge fund loses £1m.
No shares ever appear on the hedge fund’s books.

2. The Loophole

Normally, buying shares = taxes (stamp duty, CGT, etc.).
Hedge funds used TRS to:
Avoid paying stamp duty (since they never “bought” the shares).
Avoid showing ownership on disclosures (so they could hide positions).
Get synthetic leverage (exposure without cash outlay).
This meant hedge funds were economically in the market, but legally invisible.

3. The Law – Section 695A (Corporation Tax Act 2009)
   
HMRC spotted this avoidance trick.
Section 695A said: if you use a TRS (or similar arrangement), you can’t treat the returns as tax-free.
For tax purposes, the TRS was treated as if you owned the shares directly.
This closed the loophole → hedge funds could no longer escape tax.

5. Why This Matters
   
TRS are still widely used today (for leverage, hedging, financing).
But they come with risks:
Hidden leverage → investors may hold huge positions with little cash.
Market transparency issues → regulators may not see exposure until too late.

Example: Archegos Capital (2021)
Used swaps to secretly build $50bn exposure.
When trades went bad, banks lost billions.
Risk controls needed: collateral, margin calls, limits, stress tests.
